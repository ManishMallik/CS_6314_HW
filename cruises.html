<!-- In the cruise page, the user should be able to enter a destination , enter departing between, duration of cruise (minimum and maximum), and number of
guesses per category. When the user clicks a submit button, after validating the
user inputs, you should display all the information entered by the user. If any user
input is not valid, you should inform the user. Please note that you are supposed
to use jQuery methods to develop this page.  -->
